# 3D Tetris - Android App

This is the native Android implementation of the 3D Tetris game. The mobile-specific optimizations from the web app have been removed, and instead, this native app has been created to provide a better experience on Android devices.

## Project Structure

- `app/src/main/java/com/tetris3d/` - Contains all Java/Kotlin source files
  - `MainActivity.kt` - Main activity that hosts the game
  - `game/` - Game logic implementation
  - `views/` - Custom views for rendering game elements

- `app/src/main/res/` - Contains all resources
  - `layout/` - XML layouts for the UI
  - `values/` - String resources, colors, and themes
  - `drawable/` - Icon and image resources

## Features

- 3D Tetris gameplay with modern graphics
- Customizable options for 3D effects and animations
- Physical button controls optimized for touch
- Score tracking and level progression
- Game state persistence

## Required Implementation

The following components still need to be implemented to complete the Android app:

1. TetrisGame class - Core game logic ported from JavaScript
2. TetrisGameView - Custom view for rendering the game
3. NextPieceView - Custom view for rendering the next piece preview
4. Tetromino classes - Classes for different tetromino pieces
5. Game renderer - OpenGL ES or Canvas-based renderer for the 3D effects

## Dependencies

- AndroidX libraries for UI components
- Kotlin coroutines for game loop threading

## Building and Running

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Build the project using Gradle
3. Deploy to an Android device or emulator

## Development Process

The Android app was created by:

1. Analyzing the web implementation of the game
2. Removing mobile-specific optimizations from the web code
3. Creating a native Android app structure
4. Implementing the UI layouts and resources
5. Porting the core game logic from JavaScript to Kotlin
6. Adding Android-specific features and optimizations

The core game mechanics are kept identical to the web version, ensuring a consistent experience across platforms.
